# Decision Tree Classifier
# Overview
Welcome to the Decision Tree Classifier repository! This repository contains implementations of Decision Tree classifiers that I have learned and experimented with. Decision Trees are powerful and interpretable machine learning algorithms commonly used for classification and regression tasks.

# Algorithms Implemented
Classification Trees: Used for classification tasks where the target variable is categorical.
Regression Trees: Utilized for regression tasks where the target variable is continuous.
